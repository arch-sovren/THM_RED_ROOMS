CyberHeroes – Penetration Test Report

Platform: TryHackMe
Room: CyberHeroes
Author: Sovren

Objective

The objective of this engagement was to assess the security posture of the CyberHeroes web application and identify a method to bypass authentication in order to gain unauthorized access.

=============\\\\\\\\
RECONNAISSANCE:---->>
=============:///////

A simple web page containing a login form was identified.

HTML source code review revealed references to static assets.

An image file was observed at the following path:

/assets/img/profile-img.png

The login form input fields were identified with the following IDs:

id="uname"

id="pass"

ENUMERATION:-------->>
=============:////////
Network Scanning (Nmap)

The following open ports and services were identified:

22/tcp – Open

Service: SSH

80/tcp – Open

Service: HTTP

Web Server: Apache httpd 2.4.48 (Ubuntu)

Directory Enumeration (Gobuster)
Root Directory Enumeration
gobuster dir -u http://10.80.173.158 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Results:

.hta – 403 Forbidden

.htaccess – 403 Forbidden

.htpasswd – 403 Forbidden

assets/ – 301 Redirect

index.html – 200 OK

server-status – 403 Forbidden

/assets Directory Enumeration
gobuster dir -u http://10.80.173.158/assets -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Results:

vendor/ – 301 Redirect

/assets/img Directory Enumeration
gobuster dir -u http://10.80.173.158/assets/img -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Results:

portfolio/ – 301 Redirect

testimonials/ – 301 Redirect

EXPLOITATION:------->>
=============://///////

Initial exploitation planning involved performing a brute-force attack against the login form using Hydra. However, during manual credential testing, the HTTP response was inspected more closely.

Client-side JavaScript validation logic was discovered within the page source, revealing hardcoded credential checks:

if (a.value == "h3ck3rBoi" & b.value == ReverseString("54321@terceSrepuS"))

Analysis of this logic revealed:

Username: h3ck3rBoi

Password: SuperSecret@12345 (derived by reversing the string)

Submitting these credentials successfully authenticated the session and returned the following message:

"Congrats Hacker, you made it !! Go ahead and nail other challenges as well :D"

Flag obtained:

flag{edb0be532c540b1a150c3a7e85d2466e}
Notes & Observations

Conclusion

Authentication was successfully bypassed due to insecure client-side credential validation and hardcoded credentials embedded in JavaScript. This represents a critical security flaw, as sensitive authentication logic should never be exposed or enforced on the client side.
