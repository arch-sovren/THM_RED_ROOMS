# Overview

This repository contains penetration testing reports and walkthrough-style notes created for Easy rooms completed on the TryHackMe (THM) platform.
The purpose of this repository is to document my learning process, demonstrate foundational offensive security skills, and serve as part of my cybersecurity portfolio.

# The reports focus on:

Reconnaissance and enumeration methodology

Identifying and exploiting common misconfigurations

Privilege escalation techniques

Clear documentation of attack paths and findings

# Purpose of This Repository

These reports are not copy-paste walkthroughs.
They are written as structured notes intended to simulate real-world pentest documentation.

## This repository exists to help me:

Develop a consistent penetration testing methodology

Improve the clarity, structure, and readability of technical reports

Practice translating technical actions into clear written explanations

Track personal progress over time

-Scope & Limitations

All targets are deliberately vulnerable lab environments provided by TryHackMe

The content is for educational and portfolio purposes only

Difficulty level: Easy

Reports may vary in depth and structure as my methodology evolves

Some reports may be revised over time as I refine:

Markdown formatting

Report structure

Technical explanations

Professional tone

Report Structure (Evolving)

While still improving consistency, most reports generally include:

Executive Summary (where applicable)

Reconnaissance

Enumeration

Exploitation

Privilege Escalation

Proof of Access / Flags

Notes on Misconfigurations or Weaknesses

Ethical Notice

All testing was conducted in authorized lab environments.
No real-world systems were targeted.

About Me

I am actively developing my skills in:

Linux systems

Web application testing

Privilege escalation

Documentation and reporting

This repository reflects my learning journey, not a finished skill set.

Future Plans

Improve report consistency and professionalism

Add mitigation and remediation sections

Include higher-difficulty rooms over time

Standardize report templates
